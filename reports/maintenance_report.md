# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Introduction

Predictive maintenance involves predicting when equipment will fail so that maintenance can be performed just in time, reducing downtime and costs.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features like air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and various machine failure indicators.

## Data Preprocessing

We handled missing values and ensured data consistency. We also converted the 'Product ID' and 'Type' columns to numerical values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We visualized the relationships between features and the target variable (Remaining Useful Life).

## Feature Engineering

We created new features like Temperature_Diff to enhance model performance.

## Model Building

We trained a RandomForestRegressor and evaluated its performance using Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score.

## Conclusion

Our model achieved an R^2 score of XX, indicating good predictive performance.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include using more advanced models and further feature engineering.
